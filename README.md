### **API Key Note**
>**NOTE: To get the app run you have to add a NewsAPI.org key. I took this step as developer access limits the daily requests for News.**

**_Setting up API Key:_**

1. Visit [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) for your API Key.

2. Copy your API key.

3.  Go to a file named `APIClient.java` and find the value of API_KEY. Replace "YOUR-API-KEY" with your API key from above.

   ```public static final String API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY";```
